Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated
they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics,
a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their
place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. 

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she
had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove,
the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road,
the Line Lane.
